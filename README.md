# Blockchain-Based System Architecture with gun.js

This repository outlines the architecture of a blockchain-based system that incorporates the gun.js library for decentralized data storage and synchronization, alongside secure wallets and smart contracts.

## Components

### Application Layer

The application layer includes:

- **Smart Contracts**: These encode business logic and automate processes within the blockchain network.

### Blockchain Layer

The blockchain layer consists of:

- **Consensus Protocol**: Determines how agreement is reached among network participants (nodes) regarding the state of the blockchain.

- **Decentralized Ledger**: Stores all transactions, balances, and state changes of smart contracts in a distributed and immutable manner.

- **gun.js Integration**: Utilizes gun.js for decentralized data storage and synchronization:
  - **Data Storage**: Safely stores transactions, user data, and other information.
  - **Real-time Sync**: Ensures data synchronization across nodes in real-time, improving system responsiveness.

- **Cryptographic Security**: Ensures transaction security through encryption, digital signatures, and secure key management.


### Secure Wallet

The secure wallet component:

- Manages **Private Keys**: Essential for signing transactions securely and accessing blockchain assets.
- Facilitates **Blockchain Interaction**: Sends transactions, checks balances, and manages assets on the blockchain network.
